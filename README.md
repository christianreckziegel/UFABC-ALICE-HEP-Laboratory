# UFABC-ALICE-HEP-Projects

This repository contains various High-Energy Physics (HEP) projects developed by the UFABC-ALICE team. Each project focuses on applying machine learning and statistical methods to data from the ALICE experiment at CERN. Projects range from logistic regression classifiers to neural networks and feature engineering.

## Projects
